Verified modeling of a low pressure hydrogen plasma generated by electron cyclotron resonance - dataset;A self-consistent ﬂuid model has been successfully developed and employed to model an electron cyclotron resonance driven hydrogen plasma at low pressure. This model has enabled key insights to be made on the mutual interaction of microwave propagation, power density, plasma generation, and species transport at conditions where the critical plasma density is exceeded. The model has been veriﬁed by two experimental methods. Good agreement with the ion current density and ﬂoating potential – as measured by a retarding energy ﬁeld analyzer – and excellent agreement with the atomic hydrogen density – as measured by two-photon absorption laser induced ﬂuorescence – enables a high level of conﬁdence in the validity of the simulation. The dataset contains most of the simulation and measurement data presented in the related paper publication.;"Materials / Surfaces; Plasma Chemical Processes";"ECR plasma; Model validation; fluid modelling; basic research";INP;"Sigeneger, Florian; Ellis, James; Harhausen, Jens; Lang, Norbert; van Helden, Jean-Pierre";2022-10-10;dc66dc03-a157-4179-8d8c-19999bcfe8ff;10.34711/inptdat.599;https://www.inptdat.de/node/599;10.1088/1361-6595/ac963e;AURA-WAVE (Sairem);"PECVD; Creation of radicals & reactive species; ALD";"microwave; low pressure; AC; non-thermal";Electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) coaxial plasma source AURA-WAVE (Sairem): microwave frequency excitation 2.45 GHz, applied power range 50 – 150 W, volume of the plasma reactor about 70 l. ;H2;Hydrogen with a gas purity of 6.0 and a flow of 100 sccm is kept constant at a pressure of 5 Pa and 7 Pa, respectively. ;"fluid model; TALIF; RFEA";"The low-pressure hydrogen plasma driven by the commercial ECR source was investigated by a self-consistent fluid model which is implemented in Comsol Multiphysics. The model includes equations for the permanent magnetic field, the microwave field and fluid equations to describe the plasma generation. The stationary spatially homogeneous electron Boltzmann equation is solved once to determine the rate coefficients of reactions between electrons and heavy particle as functions of the mean energy. The static magnetic field is determined for each geometric configuration in advance. The remaining equations describing the microwave and the plasma are solved in a coupled system where the electron density and the absorbed power determine the coupling between the microwave and plasma parts.; 
; Two-photon absorption laser induced ﬂuorescence (TALIF) was used for the detection of hydrogen atoms. For this photons with a wavelength of 205 nm are created through the combination of a frequency doubled Nd:YAG pump laser (Spectra Physics, Quanta Ray), with a pulse width of 6 ns, and with a dye laser (Sirah, Precision Scan SL). The 615 nm red light from the dye laser is frequency doubled with the help of a BBO crystal, and then remixed with residual red light from the dye laser in a second BBO crystal for sum-frequency generation to the required 205 nm radiation. For the detection of the fluorescence a Nikon lens systems was used to image a region of interest of about 10 and 2 mm in the horizontal and vertical distances respectively. As a detector a gateable ccd camera was used (Andor iStar DH734x) in combination with a spectral filter providing a bandwidth of 10 nm centered at around 656 nm for hydrogen and 825 nm for krypton respectively. The absolute atomic hydrogen densities could be derived from the fluorescence by calibrating the appropriate fluorescence using krypton.; 
; A retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA) was employed for the measurement of the total ion current in the plasma. A separate bias can be applied to the front electrode to use the RFEA as a planar probe. The floating potential Vf was determined from the current voltage characteristics as measured by the front electrode. From this, an estimation for the ion current density at Vf was calculated by using a simplified linear extrapolation of the far ion saturation branch at floating potential Vf. For the measurements, the RFEA probe is positioned along the axis of symmetry of the ECR source at various distances in the range from 10 to 25 cm by means of a UHV-manipulator which is mounted at the back ﬂange of the chamber.;

Effect of a spatially fluctuating heating of particles in a plasma spray process - Dataset;The work is concerned with the effect of a spatially fluctuating heating of Al_2O_3 particles with diameters of 5–120 μm during a plasma spray process. A plasma jet is generated in a mixture of Ar (40 NLPM) and H_2 (14 NLPM) and in pure Ar at an electric current of 600 A. The tracing of the injected particles in the plume region of the plasma jets is considered in the framework of a three-dimensional model taking into account a turbulent fluid flow. It is shown that the heat source for the injected particles exhibits a well pronounced spatially fluctuating structure due to the enhancement of the thermal conductivity resulting from dissociation and ionization of the molecular gas in the temperature range of 2500–4000 K and 13000–14000 K, respectively. During their travel towards the substrate, the particles are therefore repeatedly heated in the gas mixture in contrast to the case of pure argon.

Upscaling from single- to multi-filament dielectric barrier discharges in pulsed operation - Dataset;A study on the scalability of discharge characteristics of a single-filament dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) to a spatially one-dimensional multi-filament arrangement driven by the same high-voltage (HV) pulses was performed for a gas mixture of 0.1 vol% O2 in N2 at 1 bar. Both arrangements feature a 1 mm gap with dielectric-covered electrodes featuring two hemispherical alumina caps for the single-filament and two parallel alumina-tubes for the multi-filament arrangement.

The effect of oxygen admixture on the properties of microwave generated plasma in Ar-O₂ : a modelling study - dataset;This work presents the datasets of the results of a self-consistent modelling analysis on microwave plasma generated in Ar-O₂ mixtures at a frequency of 2.45 GHz at atmospheric pressure. The study focuses on how the plasma properties are in uenced by the increase of the oxygen fraction in the gas mixture. The oxygen admixture is increased from 1 up to 95 % in mass for values of the input microwave power of 1 and 1.5 kW. The results show that for a power of 1 kW and gradually increasing the oxygen admixture from 1 to 25 % the electron density drops by a factor of more than 4 due to the energy lost by the electrons due to dissociation of oxygen molecules and the gas heating. An analysis of the number densities of species produced in the Ar-O₂ plasma is presented. Oxygen admixtures of above 50 % are considered along with an increase of the input microwave power in order to supply the discharge with electron number density values of the order of 10^19 m^-3. Gas temperatures above 3700 K are obtained in the plasma core along with a strong production of oxygen atoms with a number density of the order of 10^23 m^-3.;Plasma Chemical Processes;"argon; atmospheric pressure; fluid modelling; microwave plasma; oxygen admixture";"INP; Leibniz-IPHT";"Baeva, Margarita; Stankov, Marjan; Trautvetter, Tom; Methling, Ralf; Hempel, Frank; Loffhagen, Detlef; Foest, Rüdiger";2021-03-01;adeb6746-9957-4b9c-afcf-f9b2e14b21bc;10.34711/inptdat.378;https://www.inptdat.de/node/378;M.

A gas (Ar or mixtures Ar/O2) is fed through the tube. The plasma initially ignites at the position of maximum electric field but moves towards the incoming microwave. Due to the interaction of the plasma with the microwave a part of the incoming microwave power is absorbed while a significant part of the power is reflected back. The reflected power is larger in pure Ar. The admixture of oxygen allows one to couple a larger part to the plasma. Electron density in the order of 10^20 m^-3 and electron temperature of about 1 eV are reached. The gas temperature can reach values between about 1000 K and 4000 K.;The increase of the O2-admixture has to be followed by an increase of the input power to keep the maximum value of the electron number density. The gas flow rate has to be matched to avoid overheating of the tube walls.;;;;
Modelling and experimental evidence of the cathode erosion in a plasma spray torch;The lifetime of tungsten cathodes used in plasma spray torches is limited by processes leading to a loss of cathode material. It was reported in the literature that the mechanism of their erosion is the evaporation. A model of the ionization layer of a cathode is developed to study the diffusive transport of evaporated tungsten atoms and tungsten ions produced due to ionization by electron impact in a background argon plasma. It is shown that the Stefan-Maxwell equations do not reduce to Fick law as one could expect for the transport of diluted species, which is due to significant diffusion velocities of argon ions. The ionization of tungsten atoms occurs in a distance of a few micrometers from the cathode surface and leads to a strong sink, which increases the net flux of tungsten atoms far beyond that obtained in absence of tungsten ions. This shows that the tungsten ions are driven by the electric field towards the cathode resulting in no net diffusive flux and no removal of tungsten species from the ionization layer even if convection is accounted for. A possible mechanism of removal is found by extending the model to comprise an anode. The extended model resolves the inter-electrode region and provides the plasma parameters for a current density corresponding to the value at the center of the cathode under typical arc currents of 600 A and 800 A. The presence of the anode causes a reversal of the electric field on the anode side, which pulls the ions away from the ionization layer of the cathode. The net flux of tungsten ions can be further fortified by convection. This model allows one to evaluate the loss of cathode material under realistic operating conditions in a quantitative agreement with measured values.;"Materials / Surfaces; Welding / Switching";"plasma spray torch; erosion; tungsten cathode; ionization layer; evaporation; field reversal; convection";"INP; Universidade da Madeira";"Baeva, Margarita; Benilov, Mikhail S.; Zhu, Tao; Testrich, Holger; Kewitz, Thorben; Foest, Rüdiger";2022-07-07;f7116dbe-455b-451d-b7d7-8a8a48d82993;10.34711/inptdat.512;https://www.inptdat.de/node/512;10.1088/1361-6463/ac791c;Oerlikon Metco F4MB-XL;Plasma spraying;"DC; thermal; atmospheric pressure";The torch is typically operated in pure argon, and mixtures of argon with hydrogen or nitrogen with  flow rates between 40 and 80 NLPM and direct electric current of several hundred amperes.;Ar;Thermal plasma in the arc column, non-equilibrium plasma near the electrodes.;"boundary layer model; microarc model";;English;Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0);Public;Margarita Baeva;baeva@inp-greifswald.de;;;"The erosion of the cathode made of lanthanated tungsten is studied by two models considering the diffusive transport of evaporated atoms from the cathode.;

Electrical characteristics of atmospheric-pressure DBD in argon with small admixtures of TMS - measured and calculated data;A time-dependent, spatially one-dimensional fluid-Poisson model has been applied to analyse the impact of small amounts of tetramethylsilane (TMS) on the discharge characteristics of an atmospheric-pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) in argon. Based on an established argon kinetics, it includes a reaction kinetics for TMS, which has been validated by measurements of the ignition voltage at the frequency f = 86.2 kHz for TMS amounts of up to 200 ppm.

Streamer-surface interaction in an atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge in argon - dataset;The results of the modelling of an atmospheric-pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) in argon obtained using a time-dependent and spatially two-dimensional fluid-Poisson model in axisymmetric geometry are provided in this dataset. The spatiotemporal evolution of the electron number density, electric current, applied, memory and gap voltage, the spatial distribution of the number density of electrons and argon excited atoms, the electric field, electron production and loss rates, and surface charge density distribution are used for the analysis of the surface-streamer interaction and the cathode-layer formation. The analyses showed that the radial deflection of the volume streamer is driven by the free electrons that remained in the volume from the Townsend pre-phase and guided by the radial component of the electric field. The surface discharge, occurring simultaneously with the propagation of the deflected volume streamer, is governed by ion-induced secondary electron emission and the surface charges accumulated on the dielectric.;Plasma Chemical Processes;"DBD; streamer discharge; argon";INP;"Jovanović, Aleksandar; Loffhagen, Detlef; Becker, Markus M.";2022-01-24;0e609bc7-3a55-4b13-95ca-a0f9d5b2813a;10.34711/inptdat.530;https://www.inptdat.de/node/530;10.1088/1361-6595/ac63df;single-filament DBD;basic research;"AC; atmospheric pressure; non-thermal";The object of interest is streamer-surface interaction and the cathode-layer formation during the first discharge event in the single-filament dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) in argon at atmospheric pressure.

Evidence of the Dominant Production Mechanism of Ammonia in a Hydrogen Plasma with Parts Per Million of Nitrogen - Dataset;"Absolute ground state atomic hydrogen densities were measured, by utilisation of two-photon absorption laser induced ﬂuorescence (TALIF), in a low pressure electron cyclotron resonance plasma as a function of nitrogen admixtures - 0 to 5000 ppm. At nitrogen admixtures of 1500 ppm and higher the spectral distribution of the ﬂuorescence changes from a single Gaussian to a double Gaussian distribution; this is due to a separate, nascent, contribution arising from the photolysis of an ammonia molecule. At nitrogen admixtures of 5000 ppm the nascent contribution becomes the dominant contribution at all investigated pressures. Thermal loading experiments were conducted by heating the chamber walls to different temperatures; this showed a decrease in the nascent contributions with increasing temperature.

Self-consistent Cathode-Plasma Coupling and Role of the Fluid Flow Approach in Torch Modelling - Dataset;The data set is related to a two-dimensional and stationary magneto-hydrodynamic model of a plasma spray torch operated with argon, which is developed to predict the plasma properties in a steady operating mode. The model couples a submodel of a refractory cathode and its non-equilibrium boundary layer to a submodel of the plasma in local thermodynamic equilibrium in a self-consistent manner. The Navier-Stokes equations for a laminar and compressible flow are solved in terms of low- and high-Mach number numerical approaches. The results show that the Mach number can reach values close to one. Simulations are performed for electric currents of 600 A and 800 A, and gas flow rates of 40, 60, and 80 NLPM. The plasma parameters obtained by the two approaches differ and the differences become more pronounced for higher currents and gas flow rates. The arc voltage, the electric power, and the thermal efficiency from both the low-and high-Mach number models of the plasma agree well with experimental findings for a current of 600 A and a flow rate of 40 NLPM. For higher currents and gas flow rates, the results of the low- and high-Mach number models gradually differ and underline the greater appropriateness of the high-Mach number model.;Materials / Surfaces;"plasma spraying; DC torch; MHD model; experiment";INP;"Baeva, Margarita; Zhu, Tao; Kewitz, Thorben; Testrich, Holger; Foest, Rüdiger";2021-09-21;b57b0698-5708-4a04-b264-c27f16186f7c;10.34711/inptdat.384;https://www.inptdat.de/node/384/;10.1007/s11666-021-01261-4;Oerlikon Metco F4MB-XL;Plasma spraying;"DC; thermal; atmospheric pressure";The plasma spray torch considered in the present study is the commercial device Oerlikon Metco F4MB-XL.

Effect of a bidirectional coupling of an LTE arc column to a refractory cathode in atmospheric pressure argon;"An appropriate coupling of an arc plasma column in the state of local thermodynamic equilibrium to a refractory; cathode necessarily involves the non-equilibrium boundary layer between them. A model has been developed that; combines a model of an equilibrium direct current arc plasma in atmospheric pressure argon with the assembly of a cathode made of tungsten and the boundary layer. A bidirectional coupling has been realized that allows us to consider a variable voltage drop across the boundary layer for different positions on the cathode. Results are obtained for arc currents between 10 and 150A in the cases of both a unidirectional and a bidirectional coupling. The results Show differences in the distributions of the temperature and the normal current density on the cathode surface, and the radial and axial distribution of the plasma temperature. Comparison with results of a fully non-equilibrium model of the arc plasma and experimental findings from optical emission spectroscopy show a fair agreement for currents, where the deviations from equilibrium in the arc column can be ignored. For arc currents beyond 100 A, the arc attachment on the cathode appears in two forms, which differ from each other in the distributions of the temperature and the normal current density on the cathode surface, whereas the values of the total arc voltage are close to each other.";"Materials / Surfaces; Welding / Switching";"electric arcs; basic research; thermal plasma";"EMIR; INP";"Mohsni, Chayma; Baeva, Margarita; Franke, Steffen; Gortschakow, Sergey; Araoud, Zouhour; Charrada, Kamel";2020-06-24;cd737be9-21c7-4d18-ac32-3552b7c87b06;10.34711/inptdat.231;https://www.inptdat.de/node/231;C.

Unified modelling of low-current short-length arcs between copper electrodes;In this work we present for the first time a unified model of a low-current short-length arc between copper electrodes. The model employs one-dimensional fluid description of the plasma in argon and copper vapour at atmospheric pressure and the heat transfer in the electrodes made of copper. The solution of the particle and energy conservation of electrons and heavy particles is coupled with the solution of the Poisson equation, from which the self-consistent electric field is obtained. The operation of the non-refractory cathode is based on thermo-field emission. Heat fluxes from the plasma to the electrodes are considered so that a phase change and evaporation from the cathode and a release of copper atoms into the plasma are taken into account. The influence of the copper atoms and ions on the plasma properties is analysed and discussed.

A simplified voltage model in GMAW;The relation between the voltage and the arc length in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is an important characteristic. It depends on a complex distribution of the electric conductivity along the current path and does not depend on the arc length only. Based on electric measurements and the arc length determination from high-speed arc images, a simplified electrical model is introduced for a pulsed GMAW process. It shows the relation of voltage, current, arc length and free wire length and considers also their temporal evolution during the process in particular during the high-current phase.

Study of the anode energy in gas metal arc welding;Recent research of gas metal arc welding (GMAW) has proven that the sheath voltage dominates the total voltage fall in the current circuit and delivers most of the energy, which is finally transferred to the wire and the weld pool. This data set provides the results for droplet temperatures and the energy delivered to the wire anode in comparison with the sheath voltages. These quantities have been studied experimentally for a typical pulsed GMAW process in the one drop per pulse mode for mild steel under Ar with 2.5% CO2 with different peak currents from 350 to 650 A. A constant wire feed speed of 4 m/min as well as constant arc height are considered. The processes were studied with non-intrusive optical methods, i.e. without strong modification. The droplet energy was determined by high-speed two-color pyrometry and an analysis of the droplet surface temperature and geometry. In addition, the Joule heating in the wire anode was also estimated from surface temperature measurements. It was found that the averaged droplet energy is almost independent of the peak current and approximately 1/3 of the total electric energy. A voltage equivalent of the energy delivered to the wire anode from the plasma was deduced. Subtracting the work function of iron, the value of this voltage is around 3V.

A PVM500 Plasma Resonant and Dielectric Barrier Corona Driver power supply (Information Unlimited) was used to sustain the plasma. The distance between the electrodes was 20 mm in all experiments. Voltage and frequency were kept constant throughout all experiments at 18.3 ± 0.2 kV (peak-to-peak) and 24.9 kHz, respectively. The return current values were between ca. 4 and 7 mA. The experimental setup was positioned inside a large Faraday cage with the mesh size of 22 mm.;"He; H2O";The plasma was operated with a feed gas of helium with oxygen and water admixtures controlled by mass flow controllers (MFCs) (Brooks Instruments and Brooks Instruments 0254 microcomputer controller).

OES measurements of the plasma between the electrodes were performed with Ocean Optics HR-4000CG-UV-NIR spectrophotometer. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were carried out on a Bruker EMX Micro EPR spectrometer. The EPR analysis parameters were as follows: frequency 9.83 GHz, power 3.17 mW, modulation frequency 100 kHz, modulation amplitude 1 G, time constant 40.96 msec, number of scans 5, sweep width 100 G (DMPO and PBN adducts, TEMPO) or 170 G (DEPMPO addcuts). EPR spectra simulations were performed on NIH P.E.S.T. WinSIM software ver. 0.96.

The distance from the nozzle to the sample was 10 mm unless stated otherwise. In experiments when the samples were at the 4 mm distance from the sample to the nozzle, the distance between the live electrode and the sample was maintained at 20 mm. Thus, the plasma length from the core plasma remained the same throughout all experiments, and the ratio of its quartz surroundings changed. The reactor was flushed with the feed gas for 20 s and then exposed to plasma for 60 s.;The experiments involving different feed gas humidity were performed by using split helium flow (i.e., by mixing dry helium with water-saturated helium in desired proportions). Water-saturated helium was made by bubbling dry helium through a water-filled Drechsel flask at 20 °C. The relative humidity was determined by weighing the flask before and after the experiment and comparing the data with the available literature values.;"UV-Vis calibration was done using 500 µL titanium(IV) reagent with added 300 µL aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions in a range of concentrations 0.0979-4.895 mM. UV-Vis spectra of samples were recorded by adding a mixture of 65 µL of plasma-exposed sample (taken immediately after plasma exposure) with 235 µL of H2O to 500 µL of titanium(IV) reagent. The resulting solutions were incubated for 1 min before analysis. The H₂O₂ concentration was determined from the UV-Vis intensity of the peak at 400 nm.;

High-speed thermal microscopy of plasma microprinting at atmospheric pressure;"The HelixJet (; https://www.inptdat.de/helixjet; ) was applied to simultaneous melting and plasma treatment of polyamide (PA 12) microparticles (diameter 60 µm) used conventionally for 3D printing by laser sintering. This proof-of-principle experiment demonstrated that gaussian thickness profiles of PA 12 can be printed using the HelixJet with a rapid rate of 200 mg/s (peak growth 2 mm/s) and with advantageous material properties. The key element of this novel process is the self-regulated balance between material melting and plasma quenching. As a result, particles leaving the HelixJet with the gas flow velocity have a temperature slightly below the melting temperature preventing material degradation that would occur at higher temperatures. The above process has been captured with a high-speed infrared camera. The resulting movie combines the best temporal and spatial resolution for the studied process and reveals the particle temperature of 180°C to 190°C and their velocity of 0.5 m/s to 3 m/s depending on the radial position.";Materials / Surfaces;"plasma microprinting; thermal diagnostic; self-controlling mechanism";INP;Schäfer, Jan;2019-07-09;43775bda-6c4c-4060-8ff8-c847d2a6094e;10.34711/inptdat.101;https://www.inptdat.de/node/101;J.
