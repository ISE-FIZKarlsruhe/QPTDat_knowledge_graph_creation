For this photons with a wavelength of 205 nm are created through the combination of a frequency doubled Nd:YAG pump laser (Spectra Physics, Quanta Ray), with a pulse width of 6 ns, and with a dye laser (Sirah, Precision Scan SL). The 615 nm red light from the dye laser is frequency doubled with the help of a BBO crystal, and then remixed with residual red light from the dye laser in a second BBO crystal for sum-frequency generation to the required 205 nm radiation.

The oxygen admixture is increased from 1 up to 95 % in mass for values of the input microwave power of 1 and 1.5 kW. The results show that for a power of 1 kW and gradually increasing the oxygen admixture from 1 to 25 % the electron density drops by a factor of more than 4 due to the energy lost by the electrons due to dissociation of oxygen molecules and the gas heating. An analysis of the number densities of species produced in the Ar-O\u2082 plasma is presented.

{"title": "Modelling and experimental evidence of the cathode erosion in a plasma spray torch", "abstract": "The lifetime of tungsten cathodes used in plasma spray torches is limited by processes leading to a loss of cathode material. It was reported in the literature that the mechanism of their erosion is the evaporation. A model of the ionization layer of a cathode is developed to study the diffusive transport of evaporated tungsten atoms and tungsten ions produced due to ionization by electron impact in a background argon plasma. It is shown that the Stefan-Maxwell equations do not reduce to Fick law as one could expect for the transport of diluted species, which is due to significant diffusion velocities of argon ions. The ionization of tungsten atoms occurs in a distance of a few micrometers from the cathode surface and leads to a strong sink, which increases the net flux of tungsten atoms far beyond that obtained in absence of tungsten ions. This shows that the tungsten ions are driven by the electric field towards the cathode resulting in no net diffusive flux and no removal of tungsten species from the ionization layer even if convection is accounted for. A possible mechanism of removal is found by extending the model to comprise an anode. The extended model resolves the inter-electrode region and provides the plasma parameters for a current density corresponding to the value at the center of the cathode under typical arc currents of 600 A and 800 A. The presence of the anode causes a reversal of the electric field on the anode side, which pulls the ions away from the ionization layer of the cathode. The net flux of tungsten ions can be further fortified by convection. This model allows one to evaluate the loss of cathode material under realistic operating conditions in a quantitative agreement with measured values.", "topic": "Materials / Surfaces; Welding / Switching", "tags": "plasma spray torch; erosion; tungsten cathode; ionization layer; evaporation; field reversal; convection", "Group": "INP; Universidade da Madeira", "Authors": "Baeva, Margarita; Benilov, Mikhail S.; Zhu, Tao; Testrich, Holger; Kewitz, Thorben; Foest, R\u00fcdiger", "Release Date": "2022-07-07", "Identifier": "f7116dbe-455b-451d-b7d7-8a8a48d82993", "Permanent Identifier (DOI)": "10.34711/inptdat.512", "  Permanent Identifier (URI)": "https://www.inptdat.de/node/512", "Is supplementing": "10.1088/1361-6463/ac791c", "Plasma Source Name": "Oerlikon Metco F4MB-XL", "Plasma Source Application": "Plasma spraying", "Plasma Source Specification": "DC; thermal; atmospheric pressure", "Plasma Source Properties": "The torch is typically operated in pure argon, and mixtures of argon with hydrogen or nitrogen with  flow rates between 40 and 80 NLPM and direct electric current of several hundred amperes.", "Plasma Medium Name": "Ar", "Plasma Medium Properties": "Thermal plasma in the arc column, non-equilibrium plasma near the electrodes.", "Plasma Target Name": "tungsten", "Plasma Target Properties": "Tungsten can withstand temperatures up to about 3800 K.

{"title": "Effect of a bidirectional coupling of an LTE arc column to a refractory cathode in atmospheric pressure argon", "abstract": "An appropriate coupling of an arc plasma column in the state of local thermodynamic equilibrium to a refractory; cathode necessarily involves the non-equilibrium boundary layer between them. A model has been developed that; combines a model of an equilibrium direct current arc plasma in atmospheric pressure argon with the assembly of a cathode made of tungsten and the boundary layer. A bidirectional coupling has been realized that allows us to consider a variable voltage drop across the boundary layer for different positions on the cathode. Results are obtained for arc currents between 10 and 150A in the cases of both a unidirectional and a bidirectional coupling. The results Show differences in the distributions of the temperature and the normal current density on the cathode surface, and the radial and axial distribution of the plasma temperature. Comparison with results of a fully non-equilibrium model of the arc plasma and experimental findings from optical emission spectroscopy show a fair agreement for currents, where the deviations from equilibrium in the arc column can be ignored. For arc currents beyond 100 A, the arc attachment on the cathode appears in two forms, which differ from each other in the distributions of the temperature and the normal current density on the cathode surface, whereas the values of the total arc voltage are close to each other.", "topic": "Materials / Surfaces; Welding / Switching", "tags": "electric arcs; basic research; thermal plasma", "Group": "EMIR; INP", "Authors": "Mohsni, Chayma; Baeva, Margarita; Franke, Steffen; Gortschakow, Sergey; Araoud, Zouhour; Charrada, Kamel", "Release Date": "2020-06-24", "Identifier": "cd737be9-21c7-4d18-ac32-3552b7c87b06", "Permanent Identifier (DOI)": "10.34711/inptdat.231", "  Permanent Identifier (URI)": "https://www.inptdat.de/node/231", "Is supplementing": "C.

The model employs one-dimensional fluid description of the plasma in argon and copper vapour at atmospheric pressure and the heat transfer in the electrodes made of copper.

The operation of the non-refractory cathode is based on thermo-field emission. Heat fluxes from the plasma to the electrodes are considered so that a phase change and evaporation from the cathode and a release of copper atoms into the plasma are taken into account. The influence of the copper atoms and ions on the plasma properties is analysed and discussed.

Discharges are simulated between planar electrodes in a square domain with a radius and height of 1.25 cm. A background electric field of 15 kV/cm is present, which is well below the breakdown value. To locally enhance the electric field to values above the breakdown threshold, a Gaussian distribution of positive ions is placed below the anode. First test case: constant initial background density of electrons and Ions of 10\u00b9\u00b3 m\u207b\u00b3, no photoionization; second test case:  constant initial background density of electrons and ions of 10\u2079 m\u207b\u00b3, no photoionization;  third test case:  constant initial background density of electrons and ions of 10\u2079 m\u207b\u00b3, photoionization included.; Plasma Medium Name; air; Plasma Medium Properties; Gas temperature: 300 K; Pressure: 1 bar.; Plasma Diagnostics Name; fluid-Poisson model; Plasma Diagnostics Properties; Six different codes based on the finite volume method and finite element method, respectively, are used to solve the fluid equations. Some groups use adaptive mesh refinement while others use a fixed numerical grid. See B. Bagheri et al.
