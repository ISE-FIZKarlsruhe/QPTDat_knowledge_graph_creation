Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma jet (ntAPPJ);The non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma jet (ntAPPJ) is composed of a quartz capillary with an inner diameter of 4 mm and an outer diameter of 6 mm. The plasma jet operates at a high frequency of 27.12 MHz in pure noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton) at flow rates between 0.1 and 2 slm. Small molecular gas admixtures or organic vapors can be added to the carrier gas. Two outer ring electrodes (width 5 mm, distance 5 mm) are adjusted concentrically with the capillary axis. Filaments in different configurations are generated in the active plasma region between both electrodes. The applied power ranges from 4 to 20 W. An inner capillary can be used to inject a precursor into the effluent.;Materials / Surfaces;"AC; non-thermal; atmospheric pressure; high frequency";"INP; Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology; Felix-Hausdorff-Str. 2; 17489 Greifswald; GERMANY; https://www.inp-greifswald.de/en/; welcome; inp-greifswald; [punkt]; de; The Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP) is the largest non-university institute in the field of low temperature plasmas, their basics and technical applications in Europe.

HelixJet;The HelixJet is a capacitively coupled radio-frequency (RF) plasma source operating at atmospheric pressure. The RF power is applied to two double helix electrodes. The electrodes are placed outside a quartz tube fed by the working gas. The HelixJet has unique features highly relevant for practical applications. The innovative double helix electrode design enables extremely stable and homogeneous plasma conditions at low gas flow rates. This plays a crucial role for the quality and reproducibility of several applications, e.g. PECVD of SiO₂ with a large footprint diameter or plasma microprinting of polymeric profiles (e.g. polyamide).;Materials / Surfaces;"AC; non-thermal; atmospheric pressure; high frequency";"INP; Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology; Felix-Hausdorff-Str. 2; 17489 Greifswald; GERMANY; https://www.inp-greifswald.de/en/; welcome; inp-greifswald; [punkt]; de; The Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP) is the largest non-university institute in the field of low temperature plasmas, their basics and technical applications in Europe.

kINPen® IND;Plasma as a cross-sectional technology in many industry branches, but also in research  laboratories,  is  an  indispensable  tool  in surface  treatment.  Plasma technology  is  used  everywhere  where  quality,  productivity,  environmental sustainability, precision and flexibility is important. Surfaces are cleaned, activated and decontaminated at atmospheric pressure with the handy kINPen® IND. The device is particularly used for surface treatment of  temperature-sensitive  materials  as,  for  instance,  plastics.  In  addition, kINPen® IND provides you an easy access to geometric challenging surfaces such as narrow clefts, capillaries or subtlest bores. The  kINPen® IND base  model  is  argon-powered.  The  admixture  of  reducing  or oxidizing gases  can be done  up to the percentage  range. Furthermore, the device  is  convertible  through  the  simple  change  of its  electrode  head  to operate with molecular gases like air or nitrogen.;"Bioactive Surfaces; Decontamination; Materials / Surfaces";"fine cleaning; decontamination; surface treatment";"INP; Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology; Felix-Hausdorff-Str. 2; 17489 Greifswald; GERMANY; https://www.inp-greifswald.de/en/; welcome; inp-greifswald; [punkt]; de; The Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP) is the largest non-university institute in the field of low temperature plasmas, their basics and technical applications in Europe.

Ion Wind DBD;The Ion Wind DBD uses a flat plasma electrode to create a surface dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) in the room air flowing over it. An additional “extraction” electrode is arranged in parallel to form a rectangular ventilation duct. The extraction electrode is charged, so that an additional unipolar electric field through the ventilation duct is created. This drags the ions of one polarity (either positive or negative) generated by the surface DBD in the direction of the extraction electrode. These accelerated ions collide with neutral molecules and particles to form an “ion wind”. In this way, the Ion Wind DBD can remove particles, aerosols or microorganisms from an air stream (similar to an electro filter). Besides that, reactive chemical species generated by the surface DBD can more effectively enter the air volume above thereby enhancing the plasma chemical effectivity.;"Decontamination; Plasma Chemical Processes";"reactive species generation; air filtering; decontamination";"INP; Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology; Felix-Hausdorff-Str. 2; 17489 Greifswald; GERMANY; https://www.inp-greifswald.de/en/; welcome; inp-greifswald; [punkt]; de; The Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP) is the largest non-university institute in the field of low temperature plasmas, their basics and technical applications in Europe.

Hairline plasma jet (hairlINePlasma);The hairline plasma jet (hairlINePlasma) is a cold atmospheric pressure plasma source mainly for biological and medical applications. hairlINePlasma uses the physical effect of negative dc corona discharges and produces a nanosecond self-pulsed microplasma with a very thin plasma filament. The Plasma filament has a diameter of about 30 µm and a length of up to 3 cm. Due to this geometrical features, hairlINePlasma is particularly suitable for the treatment of microscopic cavities and the localized functionalization of conductive surfaces. The low plasma temperature allows the treatment of human skin without any heating or painful irritation.;"Decontamination; Materials / Surfaces; Plasma Medicine";"non-thermal; atmospheric pressure; low frequency; DC";"INP; Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology; Felix-Hausdorff-Str. 2; 17489 Greifswald; GERMANY; https://www.inp-greifswald.de/en/; welcome; inp-greifswald; [punkt]; de; The Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP) is the largest non-university institute in the field of low temperature plasmas, their basics and technical applications in Europe.

Venturi-DBD (VDBD);The gas pressure is an effective parameter to control plasma-chemical reactions, but its adjustment often requires substantial effort. In the Venturi-DBD (VDBD), the pressure can be set to any value between 100 mbar and 1000 mbar reliably and reproducibly. Using a Venturi pump for vacuum generation ensures that the system is affordable and almost maintenance-free. With air as process gas, the output gas composition can seamlessly be adjusted from a strongly ozone-dominated regime to a nitrogen oxides-only-regime including nitric oxide. Moreover, an extension to a Venturi-Vapor-DBD (VVDBD) allows treating humidified process gases for an even greater plasma-chemical flexibility.;"Decontamination; Plasma Chemical Processes; Plasma Medicine";"reactive species generation; liquid treatment";"INP; Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology; Felix-Hausdorff-Str. 2; 17489 Greifswald; GERMANY; https://www.inp-greifswald.de/en/; welcome; inp-greifswald; [punkt]; de; The Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP) is the largest non-university institute in the field of low temperature plasmas, their basics and technical applications in Europe.

Plasmaskop Jet;The Plasmaskop Jet has originally been designed to be inserted into the working channel of a conventional endoscope. It has a tube-like character, is flexible, very thin and generates a biologically active jet plasma at the gas outlet. The device consists of an inner plastic tube, a ceramic nozzle, an outer plastic tube and a metal wire. The inner plastic tube is plugged upon the thin end of the ceramic nozzle. In order to provide high voltage at the end of the tube and at the same time maintain tube flexibility the metal wire is coiled around the inner tube. The outer plastic tube is placed coaxially over the inner tube. Thus, two gas channels are created. Through the inner tube helium or neon feed gas is provided with moderate flow rates of up to 300 sccm. The resulting gap between the inner and the outer tube is used to bring a second gas (CO₂) to the gas nozzle that acts as shielding gas. Due to the use of feed and shielding gas a stable plasma jet is generated even in hollow bodies. The original development was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the grant numbers: 13GW0052C and 03Z22DN12.;Plasma Medicine;"AC; non-thermal; atmospheric pressure; low frequency";"INP; Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology; Felix-Hausdorff-Str. 2; 17489 Greifswald; GERMANY; https://www.inp-greifswald.de/en/; welcome; inp-greifswald; [punkt]; de; The Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP) is the largest non-university institute in the field of low temperature plasmas, their basics and technical applications in Europe.
